# Coding A REST API


<h2>Description</h2>
Using Node.js (JavaScript) to code a basic REST API, this project helped me get a better understanding of how HTTP works. The Express tool was used to easily accept web requests, and the nodemon tool was also helpful because it would restart the server every time I made changes and saved, instead of doing it manually. 


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Node.js (Javascript)</b>
- <b>Express</b>
- <b>Postman</b>
